## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a Machine Learning-based **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** designed to classify network traffic as either **Normal** or **Malicious (Attack)**.

With the increasing number of cyber threats, traditional firewall systems are often insufficient. This project leverages **Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms** (like Random Forest, Decision Trees, etc.) to analyze network patterns and detect anomalies with high accuracy.

> **Objective:** To automate the detection of cyber threats and improve network security using predictive modeling.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and normalizing raw network traffic data.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing attack patterns and feature correlations.
* **Feature Engineering:** Selecting the most critical features for efficient training.
* **Model Training:** Implementation of various ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.).
* **Evaluation:** Detailed performance metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.
* **Real-time Potential:** Can be extended for real-time traffic monitoring.
